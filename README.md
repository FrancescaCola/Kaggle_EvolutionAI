# From Accuracy to GPT: The Evolution of AI through Kaggle Competitions

[![View on Kaggle](https://img.shields.io/badge/View%20on-Kaggle-blue?logo=kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/code/francescaaaa8/from-accuracy-to-gpt)

This project analyzes the evolution of applied Artificial Intelligence by exploring Kaggle competitions from 2010 to 2025.  
Using the [Meta Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaggle/meta-kaggle), I investigated how the use of models, libraries, and evaluation metrics has changed over time.

## Objectives

- Understand which **evaluation metrics** have dominated in different periods.
- Identify when **transformers**, **generative AI**, and **deep learning** models started to appear in competitions.
- Analyze the adoption of **TensorFlow**, **PyTorch**, **XGBoost**, and other libraries.
- Highlight Kaggle‚Äôs role in reflecting the practical evolution of AI.

---

## Dataset

- **Meta Kaggle Dataset**: An official dataset by Kaggle that includes information about competitions, evaluation metrics, tags, code usage, and more.

---

## Key Insights

- **Categorization Accuracy** and **RMSE** were the dominant metrics for years, showing the focus on classification and regression tasks.
- **F1 score** and **AUC** gained traction after 2018, especially in imbalanced classification challenges.
- Tags such as **‚Äútext generation‚Äù** and **‚Äúspeech-to-text‚Äù** appeared only recently, indicating the rise of **Generative AI**.
- While **Computer Vision** and **NLP** remained consistent, newer technologies like **Transformers** and **Hugging Face** are still underrepresented in metadata but increasingly used in notebooks.

---

## Limitations

- The analysis could not inspect the actual source code of notebooks, which limited the ability to track **models and libraries** used (e.g., XGBoost, BERT, GPT).
- Tags in competitions are not always consistently used or updated, which may underrepresent newer AI concepts.

---

## Future Work

- Analyze notebook source code to detect actual usage of models and libraries over time.
- Apply NLP techniques to cluster competition descriptions by theme and complexity.
- Extend the analysis to include **dataset popularity**, **winning solution strategies**, and **organization trends**.
